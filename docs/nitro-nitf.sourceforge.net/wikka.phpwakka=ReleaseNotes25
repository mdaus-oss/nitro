<h1>What is a Weighted Blanket? How it Works?</h1>

<h1></h1>

If you are just hearing about weighted blankets now, don't worry, we'll cover everything you need to know about what weighted blankets are and how they work.<br />
Weighted blankets have skyrocketed in popularity over the last two years thanks to their benefits becoming more mainstream.<br />
The interesting thing about weighted blankets is that they have been around and in use for years with the special needs community. This is a typical pattern for therapeutic products. They are used first for those who need them most, and then they slowly become mainstream as people realize that they can benefit almost anyone.<br />
<br />
<h2>What Is A Weighted Blanket? </h2>

Weighted blankets are throw-sized blankets filled with weighted materials, such as plastic pellets. The feeling of weighted physical pressure can result in a calming effect. As the name suggests, this type of blanket is filled with discs, poly pellets, glass, or polypropylene plastic beads.<br />
You will find that some weighted blankets are made from softer material like breathable cotton to resemble that of a traditional duvet.<br />
A weighted blanket is typically sized to an individual, meaning it won’t necessarily replace your existing comforter. The blanket’s goal is to apply soft, even pressure to your body, which is more effective when it fits you snugly. But weighted blankets also exist in sizes that match typical mattresses, if that’s what you’re looking for.<br />
Though weighted blankets are usually one piece, others come apart, with an inner, weighted layer and a soft outer cover. Both components are usually washable, and a cover offers more flexibility when it comes to style and color. The cover also dries more quickly than the all-in-one blanket.<br />
<br />
<h2>How Weighted Blankets Work?</h2>

<h2>Aside from asking, “What is a weighted blanket?” the next question is how do they work?</h2>

A weighted blanket, which is commonly referred to as gravity blanket, is often used by occupational therapists for patients during sensory integration therapy.<br />
Weighted blankets work in a way that’s similar to an OT technique called deep touch pressure therapy (DTP). Pressure on the body can increase the release of serotonin in the brain. This neurotransmitter is sometimes called the “happy” chemical because it creates a sense of calm and well-being.<br />
It’s typically used in helping alleviate the symptoms of autism, sensory processing disorder, anxiety, as well as depression.<br />

The <a class="el" href="namespaceexcept.html">except</a> module is a base library for exceptions. 
<p>
Exceptions are fundamental to most modern C++ applications. The exception library contained herein uses the Java approach to defining exceptions. The base class is Throwable, which defines the class of all such events worthy of unwinding the stack, and being caught in try/catch blocks. Quite literally, a Throwable is something which, when produced, will be thrown.<p>
Like in java, there are two sub-categories of Throwable: Exception classes, and Error classes. Exceptions are considered to be types of Throwables that can be corrected once the state has been rolled back. They, in other words, are essentially non-fatal errors. Errors are typically things that the developer would consider serious (constituting behavior worthy of death).<p>
Generally speaking, when we use exceptions in this library, we throw our exception and we allow it to be caught by a surrounding try block. Thrown exceptions unwind the stack until they are caught by what is known as a catch block (Each try block must be coupled with a catch block. To catch, you simply need to give a parameter to the catch block. A parameter should always be caught by reference, otherwise it will take on attributes only of the class that it is caught (the benefits of inheritance are lost then).<p>
More specifically, in this library, we create an exception, usually taking a string or char* as the right-hand-side. Typically, a higher level "handler" will construct this message for us (it may be a combination of developer and handler -- similar to perror). We enforce, however, no such requirements in this package.
